# HiBooze

A SwiftUI app designed to track alcohol intake, layout and design inspired by HiCoffee Caffeine tracker (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hicoffee-caffeine-tracker/id1507361706)
Built to practice SwiftUI and gain experience working with HealthKit

# What I Learned (in-progress)
- Syncing data with HealthKit
- Saving to User defaults
- SiriKit, SiriShortcuts, Custom Intents
- Saving data across app groups
- Saving images to FileManager
- More practice with MVVM
- Combining UiKit (UIImagePickerController) with SwiftUI views through UIViewControllerRepresentable


# ToDo
- Work with dates and calendar components
